# Arduino-RoundOne
I tried to make something cool with a circuit board, and I didn't get my intended result but I got something neat nonetheless!

This was made using Arduino and Fritzing. I was inspired by, tried to imitate, and overall learned from the "5 Simple Button and Led Projects With Arduino" Istructable found here: https://www.instructables.com/id/5-Simple-Button-and-Led-Projects-with-Arduino/

This project was created by Caro Beresford-Wood.
